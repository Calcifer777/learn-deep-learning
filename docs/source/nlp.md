# Natural Language Processing

## Concepts

- Syntactic analysis: analyzing sentences to extract meaning from them
- Semantic analysis:  helps make a machine understand the meaning of a text
    - Named entity recognition
    - Word sense disanbiguation
    - Natural language generation

- Latent semantic indexing: detect the hidden (latent) correlation between semantics (words). Improve contextual awareness of the models

- TFIDF or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency indicates the importance of a word in a set.

- Tokenization
- Lemmatization
- Stemming: removing suffixes from words
