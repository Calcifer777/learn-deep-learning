# Intro

General concepts, terms, and applications

## Graph Neural Networks characteristics

- Arbitrary size and complex topological structure (i.e. no spatial locality like grids)
- No fixed node ordering or reference point
- Ofter dynamic and have multimodal features

Representation learning: automatically extracting features in a graph. That is, mapping nodes to d-dimensional embeddings such that similar nodes in the network are embedded close together.

## Tasks

- Node classification: protein folding
- Link prediction: recommender systems, drug side effects
- Graph classification: molecule property prediction, traffic prediction
- Clustering: social circle detection
- Graph generation: drug discovery, molecule generation / optimization
- Graph evolution: physical simulation

## Terms

Bipartite graph: graph whose nodes can be divided into two disjoint sets $U$ and $V$ such that every link connects a node in $U$ to one in $V$; that is $U$ and $V$ are independent sets.

Folded/Projected bipartite graphs: given a bipartite graph, a (network) projection of that graph can be created by linking each node on one set with all others that share a link with the other set.

## Graph representation

- Adjacency matrix
- List of edges
- Adjacency list

## Node and edge attributes

- Weight
- Ranind
- Type
- Sign
- Other:
  - properties depending on the structure of the rest of the graph (e.g. number of common friends)

## Graph connectivity

- The adjacency matrix of a network with several components can be written in a block-diagonal form

### Strongly vs weakly connected graph
  - Strongly connected: for every pair of nodes there is a path connecting them
  - Weakly connected: the graph is connected is we disregard the edge directions
