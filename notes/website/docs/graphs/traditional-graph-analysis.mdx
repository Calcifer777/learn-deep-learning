# Traditional Graph Analysis

Traditional graph feature enginneering

## Importance-based features

Captre the importance of a node in a graph.

Useful for predicting influential nodes (e.g. celebrity users in a social network)

### Node degree

For a given node, counts the number of neighboring nodes 

### Node centrality

Captures information on the position of the node in the network

#### Eigenvector centrality

A node $v$ is important if surrounded by important
neighboring nodes $u \in N(v)$.
$$
c_v = \frac{1}{\lambda}\sum_{u \in N(v)}{c_u}
\leftrightarrow
\lambda c = A c
$$

where:
- $c$: centrality vector
- $A$: adjacency matrix
- $\lambda$: some constant

The largest eigenvalue $\lambda_{max}$ is always positive and unique
(Perron-Frobenius theorem)

The leading eigenvector $c_{max}$ is used for centrality.

#### Betweenness centrality

A node $v$ is important if it lies on many shortest paths between other nodes.

$$
c_v = \sum_{s \neq v \neq t}
{\frac
  {\text{\# shortest paths between s and t that contain v}}
  {\text{\# shortest paths between s and t}}
}
$$

#### Closeness centrality

A node $v$ is important if it has a small shortest path lengths to all other nodes.

$$
c_v = \frac
  {1}
  {\sum_{u \neq v}{\text{shortest path lengths between u and v}} }
$$

## Structure-based features

Capture topological properties of local neighborood around a node

Useful for predicting a particular role of a node in a graph (e.g. proteing functionality in a protein-protein interaction network)

### Clustering coefficient

Measures how connected $v$'s neighboring nodes are.

Counts the number of triangles in the ego-network of a node

$$
e_v = \frac
  {\text{\#(edges among neighboring nodes)}}
  {k_2 \choose 2}
  \in [0, 1]
$$

Where $k_v \choose 2$ is the number of node pairs among neighboring nodes. 

That is, how many node pairs (potential edges) exists in the node nieghbors

### Graphlets

Generalize the clustering coefficient by counting the number of pre-specified graphs (graphlets)

Provides a more detailed measure of local topological similarity than node degrees or clustering coefficient.
