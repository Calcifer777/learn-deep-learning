# GNN Theory

## Computational Graph

GNN capture the local neighborood structure through the computational graph. 

If the computational graph of two nodes is the same (and the nodes' features are the same), then the two nodes will have equal embedding vectors 

GNN's node embeddings capture rooted subtree structures. 

The most expressive GNN maps different rooted subtrees into different node embeddings. GNN can fully distringuish different subtree structures if every step of its neighborood aggregation is injective; that is, no information is lost when aggregating messages from one GNN layer to the next.
