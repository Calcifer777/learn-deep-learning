# PageRank

## Algorithm

Main idea: the importance of a node $v$ is proportional to the importance of its neighbors.

In particular, it is proportional to the importance of its neighbors with a out-link towards $v$.

### Flow formulation

$$
r_{j} = \sum_{i \rightarrow j}{\frac{r_i}{d_i}}
$$

where $\frac{r_i}{d_i}$ is the importance of node $i$ normalized by its out-degree

### Matrix formulation

We can define a *stochastic adjacency matrix* $M \in \mathbb{R}^{|G| \times |G|}$, where each column $i$ contains to the out-links of node $i$ to all the other nodes in the graph. The non-zero elements of column $i$ are all $\frac{1}{d_i}$, with $d_i$ the out-degree of node $i$.

We can also define a vector $r \in \mathbb{R}^{|G|}$ which encodes the importance of each node, and normalize its values so that $\sum{r} = 1$.

Then, the flow equation can be re-written as:
$$
r = M r
$$

### Random walk formulation

The algorithm can be also viewed as the result of applying an infinite uniform random walk from any node.

The dynamic equation that describes the probability of the walker to be at a certain node at a given step is:
$$
p(t+1) = M p(t)
$$

It this sense, the importance vector $r$ in the matrix formulation can also be interpreted as the stationary distribution for the random walk.

### Eigenvector formulation

The matrix formulation can be rewritten as:
$$
1 \cdot r = M r
$$

So the rank vector $r$ is an eigenvector of the stochastic adjacency matrix $M$, corresponding to the eigenvalue with value $1$.

## Solving PageRank

Issues with the basic algorithm:
- dead ends: cause importance to 'leak out'
- spider traps: absorb all the importance

Solution: allow the walker to teleport to a random node in the graph with probability $\beta$; in that case, the average importance of the destination node would be $\frac{1}{N}$, as the elements of $r$ sum to $1$.

The complete algorithm in the flow formulation then becomes:
$$
r_j = (1-\beta)\sum_{j \rightarrow i}{\frac{r_i}{d_i}} + \beta \frac{1}{N}
$$

In the matrix formulation, the matrix used for the recursion becomes
$$
G = \beta M + (1 - \beta)\underset{N \times N \text{ matrix with all entries }\frac{1}{N}}{\left[ \frac{1}{N} \right]}
$$

## Variants

### Personalized PageRank

Modifies the original PageRank algorithm by allowing the node to teleport only to a subset of nodes in the graph.

Can be used to rank the proximity of nodes in the graph with respoct to a subset of *query nodes*.

### PageRank with restarts

The set of possible nodes to which the walker can teleport is restricted to a single node.

The set of query nodes effectively becomes a singleton.
